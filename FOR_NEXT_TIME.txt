[X] multiple compute nodes, with benchmark of different times (modify example to sleep to block core)
  - Example command to run with one process:
    mpirun --allow-run-as-root --host slurm-controller,slurm-node -np 1 --output-filename mpi_output /shared/hello_mpi
  - Example command to run with two processes:
    mpirun --allow-run-as-root --host slurm-controller,slurm-node,slurm-node2 -np 2 --output-filename mpi_output /shared/hello_mpi

[ ] multiple users:
  [ ] have a script which adds a user on all nodes
  [ ] see if a user can see only is own jobs somehow
